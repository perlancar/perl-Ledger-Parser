        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Rewrite implementation, interface is now different. Parsing is now
          closer to the spec of Ledger 3, but still only a subset is supported.
          The goal of this module is to be able to parse a Ledger journal, load
          it as Perl object, modify the journal (e.g. add/modify/delete
          transactions) and write it back to string/file (and be round-trip
          about it, preserving whitespaces/comments). Currently the basic parser
          is done, but no journal-modifying methods have been (re-)added. Stay
          tuned.
